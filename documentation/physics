  ## Entity Colliders

    The colliders of most entities are approximated with
    axis-aligned (upright) cylinders, though a few may be
    approximated with planes. The choice to use cylinders is
    based partly on the fact that collision can be simplified
    by breaking it down into a circular xz part and a linear
    y part; or ceilings/floors and walls.

  ## Terrain Colliders

    Say for example that you need the player to walk over a
    hill. All you need to do is move the player in an xz
    direction, figure out what polygon is directly below the
    player, cast a ray through it to determine the height
    that the player needs to be at, and then bump the player
    up to the correct height. This type of correction could
    even be done automatically by the physics engine, which
    would make ground-based entities easier to program.
