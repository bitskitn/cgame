# Compilation

  ## Effects and Entities

    Effects and entities are both hand-coded in C and
    compiled to bytecode using the `cgcc` utility. This makes
    it much easier to distribute expansions, updates, or
    modifications. The use of a virtual machine also makes
    the engine more secure against crashes.

    Using C instead of a scripting language also means that
    in special cases, effects and entities can be compiled
    directly to native code without changing anything.
