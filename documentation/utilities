  # The Utilities

    All of the graphical utilities are written in Tcl/Tk,
    because trying to create an extendable editor in C is
    migraine inducing. Sure, there are other options out
    there, but Tcl/Tk was *made* for this kind of stuff.

    For one thing, with the wish shell, there's no
    screwing around with event loops, signals, and
    callbacks. It also integrates with the existing shell
    environment, so executing external tools is easy.
    Graphical user interfaces are event-driven, so
    performance also isn't an issue. The program spends a
    majority of it's time waiting for user input.
