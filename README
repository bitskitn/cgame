# How to Build

  To build the game, run `make TARGET=<TARGET>` in a
  terminal, where `<TARGET>` is the name of the target
  platform. For example, if you want to target Windows, run
  `make TARGET=windows`.

  By default, the game is compiled in debug mode and
  optimized for the shortest compilation time. To override
  this, add the option `BUILD=release`. This will optimize
  for runtime performance and strip all of the symbols from
  the executable. Stripping the symbols reduces it's size
  and makes it a little harder to reverse engineer.
